            The Nelson Mandela Foundation (NMF) has decided to leverage non-fungible tokens (NFTs) as a fundraising 
initiative for its work, according to reports in South Africa. NFTs are unique digital assets that can represent 
ownership or proof of authenticity of a particular digital item such as artwork, music, or collectibles. In this case, 
the NMF is selling 1,918 NFTs with a value of $1,000 (R19,000) each in collaboration with digital works marketplace,
 Glorious Digital.
“This innovative and exclusive membership offers a rare chance to partner with the iconic Nelson Mandela Foundation 
and join a community of supporters from around the world, united to uphold Mandela’s legacy.”
The foundation’s decision to release 1,918 ‘founding memberships’ is a unique and commemorative initiative to honor 
Nelson Mandela’s legacy ten years after his passing.
